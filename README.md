## Features:
* You can run multiple games at once using the lobby system.
* The core engine is general. Use it to build and host whatever games you want.
* The core engine and client are open source under Apache-2.0 so can be used commercially.
* Includes spam and profanity filters.

## The Games:
* OneDay: During the night, your cards are stolen, swapped, carefully inspected and drunkenly taken by accident.
It's up to you to piece together the truth (if you're a townie) or bluff your way to victory (if you're an evil werewolf),
in the Trial, where you'll be voting to kill the werewolves among you. For 3-7 players.

* Classic: A classic game of werewolf lasting multiple nights. Featuring werewolves, doctors, cops and vigilantes.

* Mafia execution, Mission games haven't been started yet: maybe you could help write them?
