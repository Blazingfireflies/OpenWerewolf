## The Games:
* OneDay: During the night, your cards are stolen, swapped, carefully inspected and drunkenly taken by accident.
It's up to you to piece together the truth (if you're a townie) or bluff your way to victory (if you're an evil, evil werewolf),
in the Trial, where you'll be voting to kill the werewolves among you. For 3-5 players.
