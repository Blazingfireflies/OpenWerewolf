## About:

OpenWerewolf is an online multiplayer adaptation of the classic game of Mafia. This is a social deception game in which a team of evil mafia players hide amongst the innocent townsfolk, attempting to pick them off one by one during the dark night phases. But the town members have a way to fight back; every day they hold a trial in the main square where the population votes on who they think is a member of the mafia. The player with the most votes is removed from the game, and so it continues day by day until either the mafia are all dead, or they are the only ones left standing.

OpenWerewolf is 100% free and open source, and is designed to be modifiable in every way. You can create your own games, roles and mechanics using the core engine, and then add them in. If you are interested in contributing, read the short [guide](https://github.com/JamesCraster/OpenWerewolf/wiki/Contributing) for contributors, and then either create a fork and do a pull request, or make your own compatible game project in a separate repository.  

## Features:

- Many games can run at once using the lobby system.
- Easy to use graphical interface.
- Multiple game modes.
- You can use the core engine to create new game modes.

## The Game Modes:

- Classic: A classic game of mafia lasting multiple nights. Featuring mafiosos, doctors, cops and vigilantes.

- OneDay: This is a very different game from conventional mafia. During the night, your cards are stolen, swapped, carefully   inspected and drunkenly taken by accident.
  It's up to you to piece together the truth (if you're a townie) or bluff your way to victory (if you're an evil werewolf),
  in the Trial, where you'll be voting to kill the werewolves among you. For 3-7 players.

- Mafia execution, Mission games haven't been started yet: maybe you could help write them?
