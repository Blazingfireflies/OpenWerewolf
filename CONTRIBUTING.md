# Contributing

Thank you so much for your interest in OpenWerewolf!

Before you contribute, please:

1.  Read the short [guide](https://github.com/JamesCraster/OpenWerewolf/wiki/Contributor's-Guide)
  in the wiki that will help you to build the project from source and use some of the useful scripts that are included.

2. Make a bug/feature request issue; templates are provided to make this quick.  
  
3. If you have any questions or want to discuss things quickly you can head over to the #dev channel on the OpenWerewolf Discord,
  but this is absolutely not required.

If you want to you can then self-assign the problem, fork the repo and when you are done, make a pull request.
I will merge your pull request as soon as possible. If there are any difficulties I will let you know and I will try
to resolve them.
